Atlas is a website scanner, which scans the following things:

* Basic Host Info <br/>
* Miss-configured Files <br/>
* Dev Ports <br/>
* Robots.txt <br/>

Thanks to (Leetcore) https://github.com/Leetcore
and his project ninja-hacker-cat
where I have the busting.txt from!

# 1.0.1 ==> 1.0.2-ASYNC

* Atlas is finally async
* I also removed some old code which made the scanner like 2x slower
